# Penguin Clicker
### macOS version: 10.15.5<br>
### Xcode version: 12.4 (12D4e)

Penguin Clicker is an iOS game where you click to earn coins. After earning enough coins, you can purchase upgrades that increase coins per click or give you passive income. There is a reset button on the home screen where you can reset your progress. Your progress is saved when you go back to the main menu or even close the app.

Issues: 
- Core Data causes the app to crash on startup.
- Even used Macbooks are expensive so I emulated macOS which was difficult at best.
